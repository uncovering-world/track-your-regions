-- A serial site's component that moved, under its old number or a new one,
-- is the part it moved from (#2182). Western Tien-Shan's renumbered list made
-- a second part of each reserve: the arrival of a moved component was parted
-- as a place of its own beside the part whose point it replaced, which was
-- then asked about as lost. part_site_components now puts such an arrival on
-- that part, found by its name. The rows a database already holds are left
-- as they are: a fresh database never forms them, and #2119 cleans the
-- duplicates the parting of 094 left.
