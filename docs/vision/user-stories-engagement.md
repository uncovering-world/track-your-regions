# Engagement Levels User Stories

> **Implementation Status:** These features are planned for future development. They depend on the Experiences system which is not yet implemented.

---

### Define Visit Levels Through Experiences
- **As an**: Existing User  
- **I want**: To mark a region as visited with different levels (minimal, good, expert, etc.) based on experiences  
- **So that**: I can gauge the depth of my engagement with that region  

### Access Region-Specific Experiences
- **As an**: Existing User  
- **I want**: To access a list of experiences specific to each region  
- **So that**: I can understand what activities or experiences can deepen my understanding of the region  

### Access Common Experiences
- **As an**: Existing User  
- **I want**: To see a list of common experiences that apply to any region (e.g., interact with locals, taste local food, etc.)  
- **So that**: I have a baseline for meaningful engagement in any region
