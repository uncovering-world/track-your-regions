# Cultural Context in Experiences

> **Implementation Status:** This document describes the philosophical foundation for the Cultural Context feature, which is planned for future development. The database schema includes placeholder entities but the feature is not yet implemented.

## Introduction

The concept of cultural context in this service stems from a deeper
philosophical understanding of cultures through the lens of "Cultural
Relativism." Cultural relativism posits that all beliefs, customs, and ethics
are relative to the individual within their social context. Hence, what's
considered right or wrong varies from one culture to another. This foundational
idea has led us to prioritize the integration of cultural context in our
experience descriptions.

## What is Cultural Context?

Cultural context refers to the environment or setting that is socially relevant
for individuals of a given culture or ethnic group. In this service, the
cultural context is associated with specific experiences in regions and provides
an educational layer to enrich the user's experience.

## Why is Cultural Context Important?

Understanding the cultural context of a region or an experience can
significantly enrich your travel experience. It can make the difference between
merely consuming an experience and deeply understanding it.

## How Does it Work?

Each experience available in the service comes with an associated "Cultural
Context" section. This section provides users with an overview of the
historical, social, and possibly even environmental factors that contribute to
the experience's uniqueness in a particular region.

## Sources and Additional Information

For those interested in diving deeper into the subject, the "Cultural Context"
section includes links to relevant media sources like articles, podcasts, and
videos that explore the topic in more detail.

## Conclusion

By understanding the cultural context, users can more fully appreciate and
responsibly participate in experiences, making travel not just a leisure
activity but also an educational one.
