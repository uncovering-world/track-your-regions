# LOCALS' PERSPECTIVE

How local residents see and describe their region — from the inside, without tourist clichés.

---

## Concept

Traditional travel content is created by tourists for tourists. It focuses on attractions, ratings, "must-see" lists. This is useful, but one-dimensional.

**Locals' Perspective** is the opposite view: how residents themselves describe their place. What they consider important, funny, problematic, unique. What annoys them, what they love, what you can't understand without living there.

This isn't a replacement for tourist content, but a complement. "Outer view" (tourist) + "Inner view" (local) = complete picture of a place.

---

## Why This Matters

### For Travelers

Locals' Perspective provides context you won't find in guidebooks:

- **Cultural nuances** — what's considered normal/strange, polite/rude
- **Real life** — how ordinary people live, not the postcard version
- **Insider tips** — where locals eat (not where tourists eat), what to avoid
- **Humor and self-irony** — how residents joke about their place
- **Problems and contradictions** — what's not as perfect as on Instagram

This makes the travel experience deeper and more honest.

### For Local Residents

- **Voice** — opportunity to tell about their place as they see it
- **Pride and criticism** — you can love your place and acknowledge its problems
- **Connection with others** — find people from your region, exchange opinions
- **Influence on perception** — shape how the world sees your region

### For the Platform

- **Unique content** — no competing app has this
- **UGC** — living, constantly updating content from the community
- **Emotional connection** — users don't just consume content, they participate in creating it
- **Authenticity** — counterbalance to commercial tourist content

## Content Formats

### 1. "Describe Your Region Without Naming It"

One of the most popular Reddit threads: describe your place through specific details so others can guess.

**Example (Netherlands):**
> "Everyone rides bicycles, even in the rain. We're below sea level and very proud of our flood management. We're direct to the point of rudeness (by other cultures' standards), but we invented the word 'gezellig' which has no translation."

**Example (Moscow):**
> "The metro is more beautiful than most museums. In winter it gets dark at 4 PM. The city is huge, but everyone constantly complains about traffic. There's a strange tradition of giving flowers to women for any reason and no reason."

**Mechanics:**
- User with **Deep connection** or **Lived there** level can create a description
- Description goes through moderation (to avoid stereotypes and insults)
- Other users vote for best descriptions
- Top 3 descriptions are shown in the region profile

### 2. "Things Only Locals Know"

A list of things understood only by those who live or lived there for a long time.

**Example (London):**
- Standing on the left on the escalator is a crime
- "Sorry" means at least 5 different things depending on tone
- Nobody actually lives in Zone 1
- The Tube map is geographically deceptive — some "close" stations are 20 minutes walk apart

**Example (Saint Petersburg):**
- White nights are beautiful, but impossible to sleep
- "Five minutes" in bridge raising means "you have exactly 5 minutes, otherwise you're stuck for 2 hours"
- Locals never call the city "Piter" in serious conversation
- You can walk through the Hermitage in a day, but locals go there for years and still haven't seen everything

**Mechanics:**
- Crowdsourced from locals (requires Explored+ connection level)
- Moderation + community voting
- Top 10 shown in region profile
- Can filter by categories: transport, food, social norms, humor

### 3. "Locals' Recommendations"

Not "top 10 must-see", but "where to go to feel like a local."

**Categories:**
- Where locals eat (not tourist restaurants)
- Hidden spots (places not in guidebooks)
- Avoid these tourist traps
- Best time to visit X (when fewer tourists)
- Weekend escapes (where locals go on weekends)

**Mechanics:**
- User suggests a place + short explanation why it matters
- Requires Explored+ connection level or confirmation through quiz
- Moderation + voting
- Can add photos (but not required)

### 4. "Stereotypes vs Reality"

What everyone thinks about your region vs what's actually true.

**Example (Germany):**
| Stereotype | Reality |
|---|---|
| Everyone is always on time | We try, but Deutsche Bahn makes it hard |
| No sense of humor | We have humor, it's just very specific |
| Everything is efficient | Bureaucracy is a nightmare, everything requires 5 forms |
| Everyone drinks beer | True. This one is accurate. |

**Example (Russia):**
| Stereotype | Reality |
|---|---|
| Always cold | In summer it can be +35°C, and it's hell without AC |
| Everyone drinks vodka | Many don't drink at all, but the stereotype lives on |
| Bears on streets | No. Just no. |
| Everyone is gloomy | On the street — yes. At home with friends — very warm and open |

**Mechanics:**
- Template "Stereotype → Reality"
- Can be serious or humorous
- Moderation is important (to avoid politicization and insults)
- Community voting determines the most accurate

### 5. "Seasonal Insider Tips"

What changes in the region depending on season — from a local's perspective.

**Example (Iceland, winter):**
- "Yes, it's dark. But the Northern Lights are real and worth it."
- "Hot springs feel 10x better when it's freezing outside."
- "Roads can close without warning. Always check safetravel.is."

**Example (Tuscany, August):**
- "Locals leave. It's tourist season. If you want authentic experience, come in May or September."
- "Many small restaurants close in August — owners take vacation."

**Mechanics:**
- Tied to calendar — shown depending on current month
- Crowdsourced from locals
- Categories: weather, prices, crowds, events, what's open/closed

### 6. "How to Blend In"

Practical tips on how not to look like a tourist.

**Example (Paris):**
- Don't wear a beret. Seriously. No one wears berets.
- Greet shopkeepers when you enter: "Bonjour!"
- Tipping is not mandatory, but rounding up is polite
- Don't ask for a "croissant with butter" — it already has butter inside

**Example (Japan):**
- Don't eat while walking
- Don't talk on the phone in trains
- Take your shoes off when entering homes (and some restaurants)
- Bow slightly when saying thank you

**Mechanics:**
- List of dos and don'ts
- Crowdsourcing + moderation
- Can group by themes: food, transport, communication, dress

## Moderation and Quality

### Rules for Locals' Perspective Content:

1. **No hate speech** — criticism is allowed, insults are not
2. **No political extremism** — you can talk about problems, but no agitation
3. **No harmful stereotypes** — humor is allowed, but not at the expense of nationalities/groups
4. **Must be based on experience** — only users with confirmed connection level
5. **Fact-checkable claims** — if you claim a fact (e.g., "90% of people ride bicycles"), it should be verifiable

### Who Can Create Content:

- **Stranger / Aware** — can only read
- **Passed through** — can suggest, but goes through strict moderation
- **Explored** — can create most types of content
- **Deep connection / Lived there** — full rights, including "Describe without naming"

### Moderation System:

1. **Auto-filters** — filter obviously inappropriate content (profanity, hate speech)
2. **Community voting** — users vote on quality and accuracy
3. **Regional curators** — local resident moderators, final check
4. **Reports** — ability to report content with explanation

## Risks and How to Avoid Them

### Risk: Turning into complaints and negativity
**Solution:** 
- Moderation maintains balance of criticism and positivity
- "Stereotypes vs Reality" allows criticism with humor
- "Things I love about my region" format as counterbalance

### Risk: Stereotypes instead of insights
**Solution:**
- Moderators reject clichés ("all Russians drink vodka")
- Requires specifics and examples
- Community voting filters superficial content

### Risk: Politicization
**Solution:**
- Clear rules: can talk about social problems, can't agitate
- Fast moderation of politically charged content
- Focus on culture, daily life, practical aspects

### Risk: Scaring away tourists
**Solution:**
- Honesty ≠ negativity
- Many travelers value truthful picture
- "Know before you go" is better than disappointment on site

## Bootstrap Strategy: Content from Day One

Locals' Perspective requires an active community, but this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Need content to attract users, need users to create content.

**Reality:** First seed content from existing sources, then gradual transition to UGC as the base grows.

### Phase 1: Seed Content (first months)

Main goal — don't look empty. User opens a region profile and sees at least something interesting.

#### Reddit as the Main Source

Reddit is a ready-made content database. Thousands of threads where people already describe their regions.

**Relevant threads:**
- r/AskReddit: "Describe your country without naming it" (regular, hundreds of comments)
- Country subreddits: r/germany, r/france, r/japan, etc.
- r/travel: "Things tourists do that annoy locals"
- City subreddits with flairs "Culture", "Local Life"

**How to use:**
- Reddit API (free) — pull top comments (100+ upvotes)
- Automatic filtering by region through keywords
- Manual review and editing mandatory — raw content needs cleaning
- Attribution mandatory (Reddit ToS)

**What this gives:**  
In one to two weeks, can collect 200-500 quality insights for top 50 regions. Enough so every popular country has at least some content.

#### Wikipedia for Basic Cultural Norms

Wikipedia has structured "Etiquette in X" articles for most countries.

**What can be taken:**
- Basic etiquette rules → "How to Blend In"
- Cultural peculiarities → "Things Only Locals Know"
- Taboos and social norms

Easy to parse, covers top 100 countries, provides basic level of information.

#### AI Synthesis as Accelerator (optional)

LLM can synthesize content from multiple sources (Reddit threads, travel blogs, Quora).

**Workflow:**  
Collect 30-50 comments about life in Paris → LLM creates structured "Things Only Locals Know" list → human review → publication with source attribution.

**Pros:** Fast, covers many regions.  
**Cons:** Requires strict fact-checking, can hallucinate, ethically questionable.

**Conclusion:** Can use for initial seeding, but only with human review and honest attribution ("Based on community discussions").

### Phase 2: Prompted UGC (when first users appear)

When there's a base of several thousand users, can start gently stimulating content creation.

**Key point:** Not "create content", but "answer one question right now".

#### Templates Instead of Empty Forms

Instead of "write about your region" — specific prompt with blanks:

```
"Tourists think ___ about Berlin, but actually ___"
"The real way to get around Tokyo is ___"
"Never visit Iceland without ___"
```

User fills 1-2 fields, submit, done. Low barrier to entry.

#### Content During Quiz

User passed quiz, showed excellent knowledge of Florence → system asks:

> "You clearly know Florence well! Share one quick tip for other travelers:"  
> [One text field, 1-2 sentences]

Moment of maximum engagement, minimal friction, instant gratification.

#### Gamified Gaps

> "Rome has 23 local tips, but none about winter! Know what it's like in December?"

Show where content is missing, give achievements for filling gaps.

### Phase 3: Community-driven (long-term)

As the base grows, seed content is gradually displaced:
- Real UGC from users with Deep Connection is visually highlighted
- Community voting determines top content
- Curators replace seed content with quality UGC
- AI/scraped content remains only for long-tail regions

**End goal:** Fully community-driven content, seed only as fallback.

---

## Legal Aspects

**Reddit:** Can use public content with attribution for non-commercial purposes (Reddit API ToS). Link to source is mandatory.

**Wikipedia:** Creative Commons, everything is allowed. Attribution and share-alike mandatory if modifying.

**AI-generated:** Can synthesize public sources, but marking ("Community-sourced, AI-organized") and fact-checking are mandatory.

---

## Summary

**Locals' Perspective** is:

1. **Complement to tourist content** — not a replacement, but a different angle
2. **Honest view from the inside** — how they live, what they think, what they laugh about
3. **UGC engine** — content created by community, moderated by curators
4. **Unique advantage** — no travel app does this at this level
5. **Engagement mechanic** — users don't just consume, they participate

This turns the app from a reference guide into a living community of people sharing real experiences about places where they've been or live.
