# CONNECTION LEVEL CHECKLIST

A checklist for determining the depth of a user's connection with a region. Used as a complement to the quiz system and manual data entry.

---

## Concept

Connection level with a region is not a binary "visited/not visited" but a spectrum of experience. The checklist helps:

1. **The user** — understand how deeply they know a place
2. **The system** — refine the automatically determined connection level
3. **Gamification** — create progress tracking ("unlock" new levels of experience)

The checklist is optional. It's an enhancement tool for those who want to document their experience in more detail.

## Universal Criteria

These criteria apply to any region. They are grouped by type of experience.

### Physical Presence

Basic indicators that a person actually visited the region.

- [ ] **Was on the territory** — minimum level, transit passage
- [ ] **Spent the night** — overnight stay, not just passing through
- [ ] **Spent several days** (3+ days)
- [ ] **Spent a week or more**
- [ ] **Lived in the region** (a month or more)
- [ ] **Returned repeatedly** — second visit, third, etc.

### Interaction with Locals

One of the strongest indicators of experience depth — communication with people who live there.

- [ ] **Casual** — asked for directions, bought a ticket, ordered at a cafe
- [ ] **Regular social** — conversations with waiters, hotel owners, guides
- [ ] **Informal personal** — met locals, exchanged contacts
- [ ] **Deep** — friendship, romantic relationships, family ties

### Food

Food is one of the main travel experiences. Important not only "did you try it," but also the context.

- [ ] **Tried local food in a restaurant/cafe**
- [ ] **Tried homemade food** (at locals' homes or airbnb with hosts)
- [ ] **Bought products at a local market**
- [ ] **Cooked yourself from local ingredients**
- [ ] **Know names of traditional dishes** (not in English, but in the local language)

### Language

Even basic knowledge of the local language greatly deepens the experience.

- [ ] **Know how to say:**
  - Hello
  - Thank you
  - Excuse me / Sorry
  - Yes / No
  - I don't understand
  - Do you speak [language]?
  - How much does it cost?
  - Where is...?

- [ ] **Could explain myself without a translator** (at least at a basic level)
- [ ] **Read signs and menus** without translation

### Transportation

How a person moved around — an indicator of independence and immersion.

- [ ] **Used public transport** (buses, metro, trams)
- [ ] **Navigated the system** without help (knew where to go, where to transfer)
- [ ] **Bought a travel pass** (vs single tickets)
- [ ] **Took taxis/carsharing**
- [ ] **Rented a car/bicycle**
- [ ] **Walked around the city** (not on tourist routes)

### Culture and History

How much a person immersed themselves in the context of the place, not just "saw the sights."

- [ ] **Visited historical monuments**
- [ ] **Visited museums**
- [ ] **Participated in cultural events** (concert, festival, performance)
- [ ] **Read about local history** (before, during, or after the trip)

- [ ] **Know characteristic plant/animal species of the region**
- [ ] **Observed wildlife** (birds, animals, insects)
- [ ] **Engaged in outdoor activities** (hiking, swimming, skiing — characteristic of the region)

### Economy and Daily Life

Understanding how people live there, not just the tourist picture.

- [ ] **Been to places where locals live** (non-tourist areas)
- [ ] **Visited a local business** not as a customer (met the owner, production tour)

### Social Norms and Etiquette

How much a person understands "how things are done here."

- [ ] **Know basic etiquette rules** (how to greet, tipping, dress code)
- [ ] **Understand social norms** (what's considered polite/rude)
- [ ] **Know local taboos** (topics, gestures, behavior to avoid)
- [ ] **Distinguish between tourist and local places**

### Art and Crafts

Familiarity with the artistic and craft tradition of the region.

- [ ] **Saw works by local artists/sculptors**
- [ ] **Know traditional crafts of the region**
- [ ] **Bought items from local craftspeople** (not souvenirs from China)

### Recreation and Leisure

How locals spend their free time.

- [ ] **Engaged in local activities** (sports or hobbies characteristic of the region)
- [ ] **Visited local entertainment venues** (not tourist attractions)

## Region-Specific Criteria

In addition to universal criteria, each region has its own unique markers of experience depth. These checklists are generated or curated individually.

### Examples of Regional Criteria:

## Using the Checklist in the System

### 1. Manual Data Entry

When a user manually marks a region as visited, the system can offer:

> "Want to specify how deeply you know Florence? This will help the system recommend more accurate content."

The checklist is shown (universal + regional). The user marks what applies. Based on this, the system:
- Determines Connection State (Passed through / Explored / Deep connection)
- Unlocks corresponding achievements
- Suggests content at the appropriate level (for beginners — basic places, for experts — hidden gems)

### 2. After the Quiz

The quiz automatically determines connection level through the ratio of correct answers by question type. But on the results screen, it can show:

> "Based on your answers, you've been to Rome and know it pretty well. Want to specify details?"

The checklist is shown already partially filled (based on quiz answers), the user can supplement it.

### 3. For Gamification

The checklist becomes a progress system:

- **Basic level** (Stranger → Aware): 0 points
- **Passed through**: 5-10 basic points (was there, spent the night, ate)
- **Explored**: 15-25 points, including culture and interaction with locals
- **Deep connection**: 30+ points, including language, work, repeat visits

Visualization: "Florence: 18/47 experiences" — motivates to return and deepen the experience.

### 4. For Decay Mechanic

Checklist elements have different resistance to forgetting:

- **Physical presence** — doesn't degrade ("I was there" is a fact)
- **Language** — degrades quickly (if you don't practice)
- **Food** — degrades slowly (taste is remembered for a long time)
- **Route details** — degrades moderately

The system can offer a refresh through a quiz or simply ask:

> "You were in Prague 3 years ago. Do you still remember how to get from Charles Bridge to Old Town Square?"

Correct answer → connection level stays. Incorrect → honest decrease.

## Checklist Design Principles

1. **Optional** — this is an enhancement, not a requirement. You can simply say "I was in Paris" and that's enough.

2. **No right answers** — this is not a test. "You didn't learn basic phrases" shouldn't sound like a reproach. It's just recording actual experience.

3. **Progress, not grading** — we show "18/47", not "you're a bad traveler". The goal is to motivate deeper exploration, not shame.

4. **Privacy** — checklist details are visible only to the user. Publicly, only the general connection level may be shown (and even that is optional).

5. **Evolution** — the checklist can be supplemented over time. Remembered something a year later — added a checkmark.

## Integration with Connection States

The checklist is one way to determine Connection State, along with the quiz and temporal decay.

| Connection State | Typical Checklist Indicators |
|---|---|
| **Stranger** | Everything empty |
| **Aware** | Only culture/history, no physical presence |
| **Passed through** | Minimal physical presence (1-2 days, transit), low interaction |
| **Explored** | Several days, food, transport, culture, basic phrases |
| **Deep connection** | Repeat visits, work/living, deep communication with locals, language |

## Future Extensions

### Checklist as UGC

Users with Deep connection level can propose new regional criteria.

> "For Amsterdam, the checklist is missing: 'Rode a bicycle around the city'. Suggest to curators?"

Approved criteria are added to the regional checklist.

### Challenges

Based on the checklist, challenges can be generated:

- "On your next trip to Berlin, try learning 5 basic German phrases"
- "You were in Istanbul but didn't try homemade Turkish food — find an opportunity!"

Not pushy, just ideas for deepening the experience.

### Seasonal Criteria

Some checklist items depend on the season:

- "Saw cherry blossoms in Kyoto" — spring only
- "Swam in Lake Baikal" — summer only
- "Saw Northern Lights in Norway" — winter/autumn

A "seasonal checklist" can be shown — what's available depending on the time of year.

## Summary

The checklist is:
- **A refinement tool** for users who want to detail their experience
- **An additional signal** for the system when determining Connection State
- **A progress mechanic** for gamification
- **A foundation for personalization** of content (we show beginners one thing, experts another)

It doesn't replace the quiz but complements it, giving the user control over how deeply they want to document their experience with a region.
