1. ~~For UNESCO exps I see only official link now, but not to wiki.~~ **Resolved** — UNESCO sync now fetches Wikipedia URLs from Wikidata using P757 property and stores them as `metadata.wikipediaUrl`. Both Wikipedia and Website buttons now display for UNESCO sites (same as museums/landmarks). Requires a re-sync to populate existing data.
2. ~~On some items I see "Mark Visited" grayed out, even if I have never pushed it. Why?~~ **Resolved** — Multi-location experiences showed a disabled `Button` that looked grayed-out. Replaced with a `Chip` showing `0/N Visited` status indicator, which is visually distinct from a broken/disabled button.
